# credit_card_fraud_detection

## Data visualization
    - fraud vs non fraud count (plot)
    - frauds describe
    - confusion matrix
    - separate numerical and categorical data
   
## Data preprocessing
    - remove/fill null values
    - perform memory reduction
    - what features are important ?
    - what to do with categorical data ?
    - how to handle imbalanced data
        - over sampling or under sampling
            - under sampling as the dataset is huge and training takes a lot of time

## Train and Predict

## performance measure
    - precision, recall, f1 score
    - ROC curves (TODO)
